By default, some versions of IE will allow you to open those HTML files *in the context of your site*, which means that an untrusted HTML page could start doing bad things in the context of your pages. For more, see [this MSDN blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-v-comprehensive-protection.aspx).\n\nThis is pretty obscure, fixing a small bug on IE only. No real drawbacks other than performance/bandwidth of setting the headers, though.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-10-28T14:28:38.096Z","created":"2014-10-28T14:28:38.096Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T14:28:38.096Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/ienoopen","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","noopen","x-download-options"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/ienoopen.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"baldwin@andyet.net","url":"http://andyet.net/team/baldwin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/ienoopen/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"AUM9S1FP4KU3CNZ3A0SVU75ES\""}
