Simple BufferStream [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-simple-bufferstream.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-simple-bufferstream)\n\nGive it a Node.js Buffer and it'll give you a Node.js Readable Stream; that's all!\n\nIf you need anything fancier then use [BufferStream](https://github.com/dodo/node-bufferstream), it does splitting and the whole kitchen sink!\n\nA contrived example:\n\n```js\nvar sbuff = require('simple-bufferstream')\n\nsbuff(myBuffer).pipe(fs.createWriteStream('myoutput.dat'))\n```\n\nNot that you'd want to do exactly that but sometimes you need a Buffer to behave as a Stream.\n\n## Licence\n\nSimple BufferStream is Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Rod Vagg [@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg) and licenced under the MIT licence.
