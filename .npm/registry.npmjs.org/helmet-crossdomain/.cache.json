An unrestrictive policy could let others load things off your domain that you don't want.\n\nTo serve up a restrictive policy:\n\n```javascript\nvar crossdomain = require('helmet-crossdomain');\napp.use(crossdomain());\n```\n\nThis serves the policy at `/crossdomain.xml`. By default, this is case-insensitive. To make it case-sensitive:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(crossdomain({ caseSensitive: true }));\n// This will now ONLY match all-lowercase /crossdomain.xml.\n```\n\nThis doesn't make you wildly more secure, but it does help to keep Flash from loading things that you don't want it to. You might also *want* some of this behavior, in which case you should make your own less-restrictive policy and serve it.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-24T15:37:38.833Z","created":"2014-08-24T15:37:38.833Z","0.1.0":"2014-08-24T15:37:38.833Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/crossdomain","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","crossdomain.xml"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/crossdomain.git"},"author":{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/crossdomain/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"8ZTVVJV55YHDKHBTYQHV7UU03\""}
