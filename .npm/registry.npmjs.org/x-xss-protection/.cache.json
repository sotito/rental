X-XSS-Protection middleware\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/x-xss-protection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helmetjs/x-xss-protection)\n\n**Trying to prevent:** Cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), a subset of the above.\n\n**How we mitigate this:** The `X-XSS-Protection` HTTP header is a basic protection against XSS. It was originally [by Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/01/31/controlling-the-internet-explorer-xss-filter-with-the-x-xss-protection-http-header.aspx) but Chrome has since adopted it as well. To use it:\n\n```javascript\nvar xssFilter = require('x-xss-protection');\napp.use(xssFilter());\n```\n\nThis sets the `X-XSS-Protection` header. On modern browsers, it will set the value to `1; mode=block`. On old versions of Internet Explorer, this creates a vulnerability (see [here](http://hackademix.net/2009/11/21/ies-xss-filter-creates-xss-vulnerabilities/) and [here](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS10-002)), and so the header is set to `0` to disable it. To force the header on all versions of IE, add the option:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(xssFilter({ setOnOldIE: true }));\n// This has some security problems for old IE!\n```\n\n**Limitations:** This isn't anywhere near as thorough as Content Security Policy. It's only properly supported on IE9+ and Chrome; no other major browsers support it at this time. Old versions of IE support it in a buggy way, which we disable by default.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-10-23T17:30:31.105Z","created":"2014-10-28T15:04:50.693Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T15:04:50.693Z","0.1.1":"2014-12-08T13:19:07.634Z","0.1.2":"2015-03-01T19:51:39.103Z","0.2.0":"2015-10-23T17:30:31.105Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/x-xss-protection#readme","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","xss","x-xss-protection"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/x-xss-protection.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"baldwin@andyet.net","url":"http://andyet.net/team/baldwin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/x-xss-protection/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"1JEM9IHY2SU9Q8FGF5UCA5O7F\""}
