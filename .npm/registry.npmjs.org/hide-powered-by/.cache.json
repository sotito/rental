For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default.\n\nThe `hidePoweredBy` middleware will remove the `X-Powered-By` header if it is set (which it will be by default in Express).\n\n```javascript\nvar hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by');\napp.use(hidePoweredBy());\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }));\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you can skip this middleware if you want:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by');\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","created":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","x-powered-by","powered-by"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"baldwin@andyet.net","url":"http://andyet.net/team/baldwin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"F2LSJTOZGD835T7PP4E1NHFWW\""}
