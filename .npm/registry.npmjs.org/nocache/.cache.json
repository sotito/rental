This will (try to) abolish all client-side caching.\n\n```javascript\nvar nocache = require('nocache');\napp.use(nocache());\n```\n\nThis will set `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` headers to stop caching. It will also set an `Expires` header of 0, effectively saying \"this has already expired.\"\n\nIf you want to crush the `ETag` header as well, you can:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(nocache({ noEtag: true }));\n```\n\nCaching has some real benefits, and you lose them here. Browsers won't cache resources with this enabled, although *some* performance is retained if you keep ETag support. It's also possible that you'll introduce *new* bugs and you'll wish people had old resources cached, but that's less likely.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-04-24T21:35:31.799Z","created":"2014-10-28T14:36:07.244Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T14:36:07.244Z","0.2.0":"2014-12-21T20:35:07.787Z","0.3.0":"2015-04-24T21:35:31.799Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/nocache","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","nocache","caching","cache"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/nocache.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"baldwin@andyet.net","url":"http://andyet.net/team/baldwin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/nocache/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"andreaspag":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"BSESXNEOE1CBDGGOWE0NE0ODT\""}
